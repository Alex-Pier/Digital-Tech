Rhythm File: Digital Tech Society
Digital Tech Society is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering an open, accessible digital world. We believe that essential web services and software should be free and openly available to everyone.
Our core mission is to create and maintain free software across a wide spectrum of web servicesâ€”from secure communication platforms to innovative educational tools. We are committed to transparency, community-driven development, and protecting user privacy.
Currently, we are expanding our offerings by publishing a suite of desktop applications. These applications bring the power and utility of our trusted web services to a native environment, ensuring seamless integration, enhanced performance, and robust offline capabilities for our users.
